Q1: Write a method, pow, that takes two (non-negative, integer) numbers, base and exponent and returns base raised to the exponent power. (No fair using Ruby's base ** exponent notation!).

Q2: Write a method, sum which takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers.

Q3: Write a method, is_prime?, that takes a number num and returns true if it is prime and false otherwise.

You may wish to use the modulo operation: 5 % 2 returns the remainder when dividing 5 by 2: 1. If num is divisible by i, then num % i == 0. (You would not be expected to already know about modulo for the challenge)

Q4: Using your is_prime? method, write a new method, primes that takes a (non-negative, integer) number max and returns an array of all prime numbers less than max.
